/**
 * The clock behind recording: one alarm per scheduled recording, re-armed after a reboot.
 *
 * **`AlarmManager`, not WorkManager.** WorkManager is deliberately inexact and will not start the
 * nine o'clock news at nine o'clock; it batches work to save battery, which is the right behaviour
 * for everything else this app does in the background and the wrong behaviour for exactly one
 * feature.
 *
 * **`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, never `USE_EXACT_ALARM`.** The second is granted automatically and cannot
 * be revoked, and is restricted by Google Play policy to apps whose core function *is* precise
 * timing — an alarm clock or a calendar. A TV player is neither, so declaring it would be a policy
 * problem at review time rather than a shortcut. The first is user-revocable, which is why
 * [canBeExact] is consulted on every arm rather than once at startup, and why there is a fallback:
 * an inexact alarm plus a bigger head start, so a late wake-up still catches the opening titles.
 *
 * **One alarm per recording, keyed by row id.** A single alarm for "the next one" would be simpler
 * and would lose every later recording the moment one re-arm went astray.
