/**
 * Stop playing in a while, for a user who is falling asleep to it.
 *
 * One per process, because the countdown has to outlive the screen it was set on. Deliberately **not**
 * persisted: a timer that survived a restart would stop a stream someone started hours later.
 *
 * - **It counts against a deadline, not ticks.** The phone's first version subtracted a second per
 *   tick, so every late tick (a busy main thread, a sleeping CPU) made it run long. Each tick now reads
 *   [clock] — `elapsedRealtime`, which keeps counting in deep sleep — so a late wake-up fires at once.
 * - **It ends itself when playback ends.** [active] is the media session's "an engine is attached";
 *   once it has been false for [IDLE_GRACE_MS] the timer is dropped, so it cannot stop something the
 *   user starts later. The grace exists because a switch from a channel to a film detaches for a
 *   moment, and that is not the user stopping.
 * - **What "stop" means is the app's.** [stopPlayback] is assigned by the host: on a phone the tuner
 *   stops, on a television the player closes *and* the preview pane stops, which closing alone does not.
 * - **Then the screen goes off, if the user allowed it** ([screenOff]; see [ScreenOff]).
 * - **"End of film / episode"** ([startUntilItemEnd]) waits for the item's real end rather than a clock,
 *   so a pause or a seek moves it too, and the autoplay into the next episode never starts ([itemEnd]).
