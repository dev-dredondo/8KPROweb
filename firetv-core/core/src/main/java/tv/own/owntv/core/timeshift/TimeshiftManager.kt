/**
 * Which timeshift buffers exist and whether each is downloading. Process-wide: one
 * buffer downloading at most — the channel being watched — and at most one *parked*: a channel the user
 * left, kept for [TimeshiftRules.PARKED_GRACE_MS] so coming back offers "Resume from buffer".
 *
 * **Whether anyone is watching is read from the buffer itself.** A buffer with no player reading it for
 * [IDLE_PARK_MS] is parked — its download stops, so the provider connection is free again — and a player
 * that starts reading a parked buffer (the television restoring a channel after the screensaver) starts
 * the download again. That one rule covers every way playback can stop without the controller being
 * told: Home, the sleep timer, Multiview taking over, a phone put away with nothing playing. A paused
 * player keeps its connection open, so a pause is never mistaken for leaving.
 *
 * Every public call is safe from the main thread; file and network work happens on [scope].
