/**
 * The engines behind a Multiview grid: one [LivePreviewEngine] per tile, created on demand and
 * released together.
 *
 * Two rules live here rather than in either app, because getting them wrong is the difference
 * between a grid and a mess, and both apps would otherwise implement them separately:
 *
 * 1. **Exactly one tile has sound.** Giving a tile the sound mutes whichever tile had it. Four
 *    engines each grabbing audio focus is precisely what must not happen.
 * 2. **The tiles without sound are asked for less video.** The focused tile keeps the full picture;
 *    the rest are capped, which is one of the only two mitigations left for a device that runs
 *    out of hardware decoders (the other is the tile saying so — see
 *    [PlaybackFailure.DecoderExhausted]).
 *
 * The pool does not tune anything and knows nothing about channels: the screen still drives each
 * engine. It owns their lifetime and their volume, nothing else.
 *
 * Main thread only, like the engines themselves.
