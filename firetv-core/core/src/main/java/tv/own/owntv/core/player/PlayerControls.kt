 * genuinely per-platform members mixed in with the rest so nobody could tell which was which. A user
 * moving between the television and the phone had to relearn the bar.
 *
 * **The television is the reference.** It is the older and more considered layout, and the comments in
 * its HUD explain why each control sits where it does; the phone moves to match, except where a
 * control is genuinely touch-only.
 *
 * Pure data: an enum and a string key, no Compose UI. An `ImageVector` deliberately does **not** live
 * here — `compose-ui` is forbidden in core by invariant 3 — so both apps keep their own hand-drawn
 * icon sets and the rule is that they must be drawn to match.
