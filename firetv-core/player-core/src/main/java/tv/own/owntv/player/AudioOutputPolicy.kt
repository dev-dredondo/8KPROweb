/**
 * Session-wide state for the audio-output safety net, shared by **every** engine (mpv, the Live
 * preview/fullscreen ExoPlayer, the VOD ExoPlayer).
 *
 * Why global and not per-engine: the fault being guarded against lives in the device's audio HAL or
 * in the HDMI/ARC sink, not in a stream. Once one engine has proved that this TV cannot actually
 * play what it claims to support, every other engine must inherit that lesson immediately —
 * otherwise the user zaps to the next channel, lands on the other engine, and loses sound again.
 *
 * In-memory only, deliberately. A latch is a statement about "this output, right now" (an HDMI
 * handshake, a soundbar that woke up in the wrong mode); persisting it would silently downgrade a
 * genuinely capable receiver forever. Changing the setting also clears it — that is the user asking
 * for a fresh attempt.

 * — Media3's "minimum capabilities supported by all devices": 16-bit stereo PCM, **no encoded
 * passthrough**. `MediaCodecAudioRenderer` asks the sink what it supports before choosing between
 * passthrough and in-app decoding, so capping the sink is what actually removes the bitstream path;
 * a track-selection constraint alone would not (the selector still picks a 5.1 track when it is the
 * only one).
 *
 * The no-argument [DefaultAudioSink.Builder] is deprecated precisely *because* passing a `Context`
 * makes the sink query the real device capabilities and ignore anything set here — which is the one
 * thing we must not let it do. If a future Media3 removes it, the `runCatching` falls back to the
 * stock sink and we lose the guarantee rather than the playback.
 *
 * Every sink carries an [AudioDynamicsProcessor] (night mode / volume levelling), which passes
 * sound through untouched while both are off. With [passthrough] false the sink refuses encoded
 * Dolby/DTS that the device can decode ([DecodedOnlyAudioSink]), so it is decoded here — multichannel
 * PCM still, when the output takes it.
 *
 * Audio decoders: the device's MediaCodec ones first, then — with the FFmpeg audio setting on — FFmpeg
 * ([FfmpegAudio]) for what the chip cannot decode. Never FFmpeg first — it would software-decode AAC and

 *     actually starts moving, i.e. when sound genuinely leaves the device. If the first happens and
