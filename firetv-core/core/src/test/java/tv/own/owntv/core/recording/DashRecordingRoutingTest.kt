/**
 * A DASH manifest reaches the DASH recorder, and never the raw byte pump.
 *
 * **This is the guard on a bug that was live.** Before `recordDash` existed, an unprotected DASH
 * channel fetched fine — 200 OK, a few kilobytes of MPD XML —
 * [HlsMediaPlaylist.looksLikePlaylist] did not match it, and it fell through to the byte pump. The
 * XML was written into the recording file, `read()` returned −1 because a manifest is a finite
 * document, and the attempt returned [RecordingFailure.NETWORK]. `NETWORK` is not terminal, so the
 * engine waited, reconnected, and **appended the same manifest again** — for the whole window.
 *
 * The user got a file of hundreds of concatenated XML manifests; the provider got a reconnect storm;
 * one of the account's connection slots was held the entire time; and the row said "the network went
 * away", which was a lie. The same shape of bug as the DRM one in [RecordingDrmRefusalTest], from the
 * same cause: a body that is a *document* falling through to a pump that expects video.
