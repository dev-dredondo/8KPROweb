 * How close to the live edge to play Live TV, trading latency against stability. Applied on the next
 * channel open (live streams only — VOD is unaffected):
 *  - ExoPlayer live → its load control's buffer targets, and for HLS a `MediaItem.LiveConfiguration`
 *    target offset (the main HLS latency lever);
 *  - mpv live → `demuxer-readahead-secs` and `cache-secs`, set alike.
 *
 * [BALANCED] is the default and applies no override — the engines keep their existing behaviour, so
 * it can never regress a stream that already works.

     * `LivePreviewEngine`'s re-buffer-flap detector is the backstop for that (it drops the pre-roll for
     * that stream), because no sane heap budget holds 10 s of a 4K channel.

     * with mpv's 48 MiB cache while an engine handoff overlaps the two.
