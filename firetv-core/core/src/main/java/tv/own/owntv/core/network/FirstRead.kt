 * IP leak for someone using the proxy for privacy, and a failed tune for someone using it to reach the
 * provider at all. Only callers on network threads wait (OkHttp's proxy selector and DNS, mpv's load
 * on its own executor) — never the main thread — and only until the first read, [timeoutMs] at most.
