/**
 * Backup format v17: the fixes for the three silent-data-loss classes an audit found in the
 * export/restore path. Every case here failed before that change.
 *
 *  1. **Per-item player keys were never remapped.** [tv.own.owntv.core.player.enginePinKey] is
 *     "<sourceId>:<TYPE>:<remoteId>", but the compatibility-mode pins and the per-item zoom/volume
 *     rows were imported verbatim — so after a merge restore they named a source id that either did
 *     not exist here or, worse, belonged to somebody else's playlist.
 *  2. **Source-keyed blocks were exported unscoped.** An id whose source is not in the file cannot
 *     be remapped on restore, and an unmapped numeric id happily matches whatever unrelated source
 *     holds that number on the target device.
 *  3. **New [SourceEntity] fields were quietly dropped.** `preferHls` and `livePrerollSecs` shipped
 *     without ever being added to the backup, and nothing failed. [sourceEntityFieldParity] is the
 *     tripwire: adding a field to the entity now breaks this test until the author decides.
