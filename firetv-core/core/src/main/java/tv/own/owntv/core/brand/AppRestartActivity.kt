/**
 * "Restart now" after an icon change or a setting that applies at start, done from outside the app's own
 * process.
 *
 * The app cannot reopen itself and then die: the screen it asked for is started in the process being
 * killed, and Android drops it with the process — the icon changed and the app stayed closed. This
 * invisible activity runs in its own `:restart` process (see core's manifest), so it outlives the old
 * one: it ends the old process, opens the app through the new launcher activity and ends itself.
 * Each app's `Application.onCreate` returns at once in this process ([AppIconSwitcher.isRestartProcess]).
