OwnTV Core is the **headless half** of [OwnTV](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV), the open-source
IPTV **player** for Android TV. Everything that is not a screen lives here: the Room database and
every migration, playlist sync and parsing for **M3U / Xtream / Stalker**, EPG, backup and restore,
profiles, downloads, settings storage, **every user-visible string**, and the **dual playback
engine** — libmpv (FFmpeg) plus Media3/ExoPlayer.

Neither module renders anything. They use the Compose **runtime** for state, but no `compose-ui`,
no `compose-foundation`, no `androidx.tv.*` and no navigation — that is exactly what lets one engine
back both the Android TV app and the phone/tablet app.

> ⚠️ OwnTV provides **no** channels, playlists, subscriptions, streams or media content. This is
> library code for building a player; the sources are the user's own.

## 📦 The two modules

Published together, always on one version — two artifacts that must be used as a pair should not
have numbers that can disagree.

| Module | Namespace | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **`:core`** | `tv.own.owntv.core` | Room database and migrations, sync, parsers, EPG, backup, profiles, downloads, settings, metadata, and every string. |
| **`:player-core`** | `tv.own.owntv.playercore` | The playback engine — libmpv plus the Media3/ExoPlayer handoff, the fallback ladder, watchdogs, live tuning shared by both apps (`LiveTuneController`) and stream diagnostics. Depends on `:core`. |

## ✨ What's inside

### 🎬 Playback (`:player-core`)
- **Dual engine** — libmpv (FFmpeg) for maximum codec compatibility, ExoPlayer (Media3) for
  near-instant Live TV, with an automatic fallback ladder between them
- **Every sound format on both engines** — ExoPlayer falls back to the FFmpeg that ships with the mpv
  engine for audio the device can't decode (DTS, TrueHD, MP2…), after the device's own decoders and
  passthrough
- **HLS, MPEG-DASH and raw MPEG-TS**, chosen from what the playlist declares, what the response
  actually is, and what the panel has already been caught doing — plus **Widevine / ClearKey** for
  channels that publish a licence server, and ClearKey keys written into the playlist itself
  (ExoPlayer only; mpv has no CDM)
- **Watchdogs that assume the stream is hostile** — no-frame detection, stall recovery, surface
  resets, reconnect logic, and a live diagnostics log
- Zero-copy **4K HDR** direct rendering, frame-rate matching, throughput tracking, resolution and
  codec reporting, volume boost, subtitle shift and language selection
- Live timeline geometry for catch-up/rewind, hero and preview engines for browse screens

### 🗄️ Data & sync (`:core`)
- **Room** database with the full migration chain, plus paging
- Source parsing and sync for **M3U**, **Xtream Codes** and **Stalker/Ministra (MAC portal)** —
  incremental upserts, category fallbacks, and relinking of favourites, history and progress
- **EPG** (XMLTV) ingest, catch-up, and the guide's data model
- Backup and restore, including encrypted password backup, and cross-device companion transfer
- **Local sync** — two OwnTV devices on the same Wi-Fi exchanging their data directly, with no
  account and no cloud: discovery, pairing, the merge rule (the newer of two facts wins), the
  tombstones that make a deletion survive it, and a payload the two devices seal between
  themselves without ever asking the user for a passphrase
- Profiles, downloads, settings storage, TMDB metadata and trending, weather, update checks

### 🌍 Strings & translations (`:core`)
- Six Android resource components, **26 packaged locales**, and the toolkit that guards them:
  hardcoded-literal inventory, plural/CLDR validation, number-locale checks, overflow checks

## 🔗 Who depends on this

- **[OwnTV for Android TV](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV)** — televisions and set-top boxes, shipping.
- **[OwnTV for mobile](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV_Mobile)** — phones and tablets, shipping.

**A change here affects both.** Nothing is released from here until the TV app has been rebuilt
against it. There is no such thing as a change that only affects one app.

Both apps are updated automatically. Publishing a release here opens a pull request on each of them
that moves its `owntvCore` pin and refreshes its copy of `tools/i18n/locales.json`, and each app
merges that pull request itself once it has confirmed the two files agree with this repository. No
app pins a core version by hand.

## 🛠️ Building

Requires **JDK 21** and an Android SDK. Put the SDK path in `local.properties`:

```properties
sdk.dir=C:/Path/To/Android/Sdk
```

Then:

```bash
./gradlew :core:assembleRelease :player-core:assembleRelease   # build both AARs
./gradlew :core:testDebugUnitTest :player-core:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew build                                                # everything, including lint
```

Instrumentation tests need a device or emulator, and are **never** run against a real TV that holds
real data — installing a test APK wipes the catalog, playlists, profiles and history.

```bash
./gradlew :core:assembleDebugAndroidTest        # compiles the test APK, installs nothing
```

## 📥 Consuming core from an app

Core publishes `tv.own.owntv:core` and `tv.own.owntv:player-core` to OwnTV's own Maven repository —
public, **no account or token needed**. It also serves `tv.own.owntv:libmpv`, the mpv engine built by
[OwnTV_libmpv](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV_libmpv), which `player-core` depends on.

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
maven {
    url = uri("https://ahxn00.github.io/OwnTV_Core/maven")
    content { includeGroup("tv.own.owntv") }
}

// build.gradle.kts
implementation("tv.own.owntv:core:1.0.58")
implementation("tv.own.owntv:player-core:1.0.58")
```

The repository is this repo's `gh-pages` branch, written only by the publish workflows (the newest 30
core versions are kept). Versions up to 1.0.57 were also published to GitHub Packages, which needs a
token.

### Local development against core's source

```properties
owntv.corePath=E:/Path/To/OwnTV_Core
```

The app's `settings.gradle.kts` picks that up and includes this repo as a **composite build**, so a
core edit shows up in the next app build with no publish step. Leave the property unset and the app
resolves the published artifact instead, which is what CI does.

### Hooks an app must supply

Core deliberately knows nothing about the app hosting it. Five hooks are assigned in the
application's `onCreate`, **before Koin starts** — `CrashRecorder` reads the version before the
container exists:

| Hook | Supplies |
|---|---|
| `CoreBuildInfo` | versionName, versionCode, edgeKey, devTools, debug, diagnosticBuild |
| `CrashRecorder.diagnostics` | the live diagnostics log |
| `LiveSessionLimit.report` | per-provider stream quirks |
| `SubtitleFontAssets.resourceOf` | the app's bundled subtitle fonts |
| `AppIconSwitcher.mainActivityClass` | the app's `MainActivity`; the icon colours are it + `AppIcon.activitySuffix` |

`onCreate` also **returns at once when `AppIconSwitcher.isRestartProcess(this)`** — the few
milliseconds core's `AppRestartActivity` runs in its own process to reopen the app after an icon
change, where nothing may start. After Koin it calls `AppIconSwitcher.start()` and
`PlaybackStartup.start(...)`. The two engines are built with player-core's `ownTVPlayer()` and
`livePreviewEngine()` inside the app's own Koin module (player-core ships none).

One more is supplied from the playback screen rather than `onCreate`, because it is a live signal
rather than a value:

| Hook | Supplies |
|---|---|
| `WatchSession` | which playlist is on screen — `open(sourceId)` / `close(sourceId)` |

`WatchSession` is what lets core's background work step out of the user's way. The playback engines
in `:player-core` are handed a URL and have no notion of a `sourceId`, and fullscreen playback never
claims against `OpenStreamRegistry` — that register is the connection budget for Multiview and
recordings. So the host screen, which holds the row, is the only place the answer exists. An app that
does not supply it still works; its background catalogue drain simply never yields to playback.

An app also needs `android.nonTransitiveRClass=false` in its `gradle.properties` if it references
core's strings as a bare `R.string.*`.

## 🌍 Translations

<!-- i18n-contribution:start -->
## Help translate OwnTV

If your language is already available, contribute interface translations across OwnTV's six Android resource components on [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/owntv/). If it is not listed, [open a language request ticket](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BLanguage%5D%20Add%20) first. A maintainer will review the request, register the locale, and prepare its base translation files on Hosted Weblate. Once the language appears on Hosted Weblate, you can start translating it there. See the [language contributor guide](tools/i18n/README.md) for identifiers, validation, and promotion policy.
<!-- i18n-contribution:end -->

New user-visible text is never English-only: a string is not finished until it exists in every
packaged locale. All four validators must pass before any string change lands:

```bash
python tools/i18n/validate_strings.py
python tools/i18n/check_hardcoded_strings.py verify --bootstrap
python tools/i18n/gen_supported_locales.py check
python tools/i18n/check_text_overflow.py
```

## 🔢 Versioning

Core versions are **independent of the TV app's `v4.x` releases** and must never be confused with
them. Tags are prefixed — `core-1.0.0` — and pushing one publishes both modules from CI. The
**Release core** workflow (Actions tab → Run workflow) pushes that tag for you: it reads `coreVersion`
from `main` and refuses if the tag already exists or `CHANGELOG.md` has no section for it.

Every published version also gets a [**GitHub Release**](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV_Core/releases),
and the order is deliberate: CI runs the full gate, publishes both artifacts to the Maven repository, waits
until they are served, and only then publishes the release. So a release exists only for a version that actually built and
shipped — and it is the release, not the tag, that opens the pull request moving each app onto the
new version. A tag whose tests fail stops there, with nothing downstream moved.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions, bug reports and ideas are welcome. Two things to know before opening a pull request:

- **Core never imports from an app.** The dependency arrow is one-way: app → `:player-core` →
  `:core`. If core needs something from the host, it takes a hook the app assigns.
- **Core stays UI-framework-neutral.** `compose-runtime` is the only Compose artifact allowed.
  Anything else makes core unusable from the mobile app.
