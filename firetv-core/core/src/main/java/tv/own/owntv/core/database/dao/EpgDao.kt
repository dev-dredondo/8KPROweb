    // --- Guide reads: keyed by epgChannelId ALONE ------------------------------------------------
    //
    // None of the four queries below filters by sourceId, and that is the fix for a bug that outlived
    // two attempts at it. A channel's guide is identified by its `epgChannelId`; which playlist or EPG
    // feed happened to deliver a row is not part of that identity. Filtering on it meant that a row
    // whose source had since been deleted, or re-added and given a new id, became invisible — while
    // `nowPlaying`/`upcoming` above, which never filtered, still found it. So the preview pane showed a
    // full guide and the grid and the channel row beside it stayed blank, permanently, for every
    // affected channel.
    //
    // The list had already been widened once (playlists PLUS EPG feeds) after the same class of report.
    // Widening it a third time would only move the boundary; removing it is what makes all three reads
    // answer identically. Two feeds carrying one channel now both come back, which is what
    // [tv.own.owntv.core.epg.EpgDedupe] collapses.

    // `programmesInWindowPage` used to live here — the keyset-paged read behind GuideReader.window().
    // Both are gone. It could never use an index: keysetting on `id` walks the table in rowid order,
    // so drawing eight rows examined every programme in the database. See the note in GuideReader.

    // Every windowed read below carries `startMs > :from - 86400000` as well as the obvious
    // `stopMs > :from`. Without it there is no lower bound on startMs, so SQLite cannot seek into the
    // (epgChannelId, startMs) index — it walks every row the channel has ever had and tests each one.
    // With it the read becomes a range seek over exactly the span asked for.
    //
    // 86400000 is twenty-four hours, and it is an assumption, stated here so it can be found: a
    // programme that started MORE than a day before the window and is still running would be missed.
    // Nothing in a television schedule runs that long; a feed that claims otherwise is malformed.
