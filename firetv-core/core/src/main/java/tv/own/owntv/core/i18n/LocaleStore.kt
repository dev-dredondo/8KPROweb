/**
 * The single source of truth for the selected application locale, as a BCP-47 tag. `""`
 * ([AppLocale.SYSTEM_DEFAULT_TAG]) means "follow the current device locale list".
 *
 * **Why SharedPreferences and not DataStore** (see `docs/internationalization.md` 0b): the selected
 * locale must be readable *synchronously* from `Application.attachBaseContext` and
 * `Activity.attachBaseContext`. DataStore is asynchronous and cannot be read cleanly from those
 * lifecycle hooks without blocking or restructuring startup. This one bootstrap-critical setting
 * therefore lives in SharedPreferences — alone, with no DataStore mirror, no dual write, and no
 * mirror-repair collector (all of v1's reconciliation complexity is gone because OwnTV no longer
 * participates in the Android system per-app-language screen).
 *
 * Every locale write goes through [set]: the in-app picker, "reset to system default" (`""`),
 * backup import, and any settings-reset operation. There is no second write path.
