/**
 * One channel's timeshift buffer on disk: a folder of short pieces, the oldest dropped as the
 * newest arrive, and any number of readers following it — each reader is a player watching from some
 * piece onwards, at the live edge or behind it.
 *
 * **Readers block, they never see "the end".** A reader that reaches the piece still being written
 * waits for more, exactly as a network socket waits for the provider; that is what lets a paused player
 * resume from the saved copy and lets the live edge play with no added delay. Only [close] ends a reader.
 *
 * Thread-safe: one writer (the downloader) and blocking readers (the local server's threads) share
 * [lock]. Wall times are the viewer's clock: a piece starts where the previous one ended, re-anchored to
 * arrival after a gap, so a burst of bytes never compresses minutes of television into a second.
