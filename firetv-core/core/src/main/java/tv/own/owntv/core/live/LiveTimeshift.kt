/**
 * Live rewind / timeshift: watching a catch-up-capable channel some seconds behind the live edge,
 * out of the provider's rolling archive, and the "watching" clock that says which wall-clock instant
 * the picture actually belongs to.
 *
 * Split out of `LiveViewModel`, which was doing four jobs at once. The seam is deliberately narrow —
 * **offset in, archive load out**: this class owns how far back the user is, when to (re)load, and the
 * two counters that tick while an archive plays. It owns nothing about *how* a stream is opened: the
 * URL construction, the engine handover and `player.play` stay with the view model and arrive here as
 * [loadArchive]. The ladder and its outcome watcher are untouched by design.
 *
 * Everything time-related is injected ([nowMs], [coalesceMs], [tickMs]) and playback is read through
 * [Playback], so the sequencing is unit-testable without a player, a database or a view model.
