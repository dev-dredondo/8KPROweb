 * Both apps run this. What a profile *is* spans more tables than the `profiles` row itself: its
 * sources, its OpenSubtitles login, its "start on this channel" target, and the app-wide active id
 * that every screen resolves its content against. Two independent implementations of that would
 * drift, and the two apps share one database.
