 * The OkHttp client the **playback** engines stream through.
 *
 * It is derived from the app-wide singleton with [OkHttpClient.newBuilder], so it keeps every piece of
 * shared configuration — proxy selector/authenticator, custom DNS, timeouts, HTTP/1.1, the default
 * User-Agent interceptor — and picks up runtime proxy/DNS changes exactly as before. What it does *not*
 * share is the **connection pool**: this one owns its sockets.
 *
 * That split is the whole point. A panel that allows one session per account refuses the second
 * client, so after an engine handoff a pooled ExoPlayer connection can lock mpv out of the channel the
 * user just asked for — the live engine therefore evicts its idle sockets on every stop. Evicting the
 * *singleton's* pool did that to the whole app: EPG downloads, panel API calls, TMDB metadata and Coil
 * image loads all lost keep-alive on every zap and paid a fresh TCP+TLS handshake afterwards.
 * [evictAll] here touches stream connections only.
