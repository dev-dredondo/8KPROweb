/**
 * Where a profile's own picture lives once the user has chosen one.
 *
 * Both apps let a picture in from more than one direction — a file on the television's storage, a
 * photo sent from a phone over the local network, the phone's own photo picker — and every one of
 * them ends here, so the rules are written once: the image is **copied** into app-private storage
 * (a picture on a USB stick must not vanish when the stick does), cropped square about its centre,
 * scaled down to [SIZE_PX], and written as JPEG.
 *
 * Scaling is the point, not a nicety. A profile picture is drawn at about 40 dp in a settings row
 * and 96 dp on the profile gate; keeping a 12-megapixel phone photo to decode on every one of those
 * would cost far more memory than the whole rest of the screen.
