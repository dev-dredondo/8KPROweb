/**
 * A programme reminder (v47): "tell me when this starts". The alarm fires [leadMinutes]
 * before [startMs]; the apps show the prompt, core only keeps time.
 *
 * Shaped after [RecordingEntity]: `profileId` cascades with its profile; `channelId` is a local id that
 * goes stale on a re-sync, so `channelName` and `epgChannelId` travel with it to keep the row readable
 * and re-matchable. A row lives for hours or days and is deleted once its programme has ended or the
 * user dismisses the prompt, so it takes no part in local sync or backup.
