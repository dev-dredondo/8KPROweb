/**
 * One live recording: scheduled, running, finished, or the reason it never happened.
 *
 * **None of this syncs and none of it is backed up.** A recording is a file on one device's
 * disk; a row that arrived on another device would name a file that is not there, which is worse
 * than saying nothing. So there are no tombstones here, `UserDataResolver` does not know this table,
 * and neither does the backup writer. That is deliberate, not an omission — if a later change adds
 * this table to either, it is changing a deliberate decision, not filling a gap.
 *
 * **Deleting the playlist does not delete the recording.** `sourceId` is an ordinary column and not
 * a foreign key, precisely so removing a playlist cannot cascade away a row whose file is still on
 * disk — "never destroy what was captured" applies to the record of it too. `profileId` *is* a
 * cascade, matching every other user-data table: a deleted profile takes its own rows with it.
 *
 * **Two windows, not one.** `programmeStartMs`/`programmeStopMs` are the EPG's — what the user
 * pointed at, and what the row should always be described by. `startMs`/`stopMs` are what is
 * actually recorded, pre-roll and post-roll included. Keeping both is what lets the screen say
 * "the 9 o'clock news" while the recorder runs from 20:58 to 21:35.
 *
 * `channelId` is a local id and goes stale on a re-sync, exactly as `DownloadEntity.itemId` does.
 * `channelName` and `epgChannelId` are stored beside it so a row stays readable, and re-matchable,
 * after the catalogue underneath it has been replaced.
