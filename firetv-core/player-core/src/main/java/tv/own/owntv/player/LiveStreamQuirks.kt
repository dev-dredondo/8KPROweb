/**
 * Per-provider live-stream quirks learned at runtime, shared by both engines.
 *
 * Everything here is **in-memory for the session only** — so a provider that fixes its panel is back
 * to stock behaviour after the next app start. Keyed by `host:port` so a
 * lesson learned on one channel applies immediately to every other channel of the same panel
 * (these faults are panel-wide, not per-channel).
 *
 * Three quirks are tracked:
 *
 *  1. **`.ts` that is really HLS.** Some Xtream panels advertise `/live/user/pass/ID.ts` but
 *     HTTP-redirect it to an `.m3u8` manifest. ExoPlayer picks its media source from the URL
 *     *before* that redirect and hands a text manifest to the progressive extractor
 *     (`ERROR_CODE_PARSING_CONTAINER_UNSUPPORTED`); mpv/FFmpeg treats the manifest response's EOF as
 *     a broken raw stream and reconnects to the same 1.8 KB body forever (permanent black screen).
 *     Once either engine has seen the redirect land on a manifest we remember it here.
 *
 *  2. **Per-segment signed URLs that Media3 cannot keep fresh.** The panel this was traced on hands
 *     out segment URLs carrying a short-lived signed token
 *     (`/serve/<id>/<token>/<token>/…/136875_2559.ts`) and answers **every** one of them with
 *     `403 "Invalid token 2"` — the playlist itself keeps returning 200, and not a single segment ever
 *     succeeds. Media3's chunk pipeline can only re-issue the *identical* URL it resolved from the
 *     playlist snapshot, so once a token has aged out the channel can never recover; FFmpeg (mpv, VLC)
 *     re-reads the playlist and fetches with a fresh token, which is why the same channel plays there,
 *     lagging but alive. There is nothing to tune — the fix is to recognise the pattern quickly and
 *     hand the panel to mpv, rather than grinding ExoPlayer's reconnect ladder on a dead channel.
 *
 *  3. **A panel that blocklists the default User-Agent.** Some hosts sit behind a WAF that refuses
 *     player identities by name. Traced on a Cloudflare-fronted panel that answers every request
 *     carrying `VLC/3.0.20 LibVLC/3.0.20` with a `403` challenge page ("Just a moment…") and serves the
 *     identical URL `200` to a neutral UA. Both engines send the VLC identity, so such a channel fails
 *     on ExoPlayer, walks the whole fallback ladder, and fails on mpv too — indistinguishable from a
 *     dead provider. Once either engine has been refused this way we remember it here, so every other
 *     channel on the panel opens under [tv.own.owntv.core.network.HttpClient.FALLBACK_USER_AGENT]
 *     first time instead of repeating the failure.
