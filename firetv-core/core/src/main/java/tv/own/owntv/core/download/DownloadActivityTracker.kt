/**
 * App-wide "a download is running" signal for the shell's status pill, shaped after
 * [tv.own.owntv.core.sync.SyncActivityTracker] and [tv.own.owntv.core.sync.EpgActivityTracker].
 * [DownloadEngine] reports here as it transfers, so the pill both apps already have can carry a
 * download line alongside the sync lines. Purely observational: nothing reads this to make decisions.
 *
 * Downloads run strictly one at a time ([DownloadEngine.drainQueue] serialises them), so there is at
 * most one active transfer — hence a single nullable rather than a map.
