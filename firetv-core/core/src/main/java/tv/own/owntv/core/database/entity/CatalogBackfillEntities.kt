/**
 * One category's outstanding VOD pages on a Stalker portal (v42).
 *
 * Stalker has no bulk VOD endpoint and the portals that matter cap `max_page_items` at ~14, so a
 * full catalogue is thousands of round trips — measured at 4,681 pages for 65,523 movies plus 1,567
 * for 21,932 series on the reference portal, which is 4½ minutes the user spends watching a progress
 * bar at setup.
 *
 * Setup therefore stops after the page-1 sweep it already performs: that sweep is cheap (~11 s for
 * both types, concurrent), it learns every category's `total_items`, and it already yields the first
 * page of every category — so the top of every list is browsable immediately. The pages it did *not*
 * fetch are written here, and drained afterwards in the background or on demand when the user
 * opens that category.
 *
 * One row per (source, media type, category) rather than one per page: the page *range* is what the
 * plan produces, ranges survive a portal that re-paginates between runs, and 139 rows is a far
 * cheaper thing to keep consistent than 4,593.
 *
 * [sortBase] is the load-bearing column. It is the category's first slot on the provider-order sort
 * axis, computed once during the page-1 sweep when the whole category layout is known. Re-deriving
 * it later would be wrong — a category's base depends on every *preceding* category's page count —
 * and `sortOrder` is deliberately not part of the content hash, so a scrambled backfill would be
 * frozen in place forever. Persisting it is what makes a lazily-loaded row and a backfilled row land
 * in the same order.
