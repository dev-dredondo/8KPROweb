/**
 * The sleep timer's "and turn the screen off".
 *
 * An app cannot put a device to sleep — that takes a permission only the firmware holds. The one door
 * open to an ordinary app is the device-admin "force lock" policy: `lockNow()` is the power button,
 * the screen goes off and, on most Android TVs, the set goes to standby. The user grants it once in a
 * system screen, and **the grant is the setting**: nothing is stored, so there is nothing to back up
 * or to restore onto a device that never granted it. Unticking the row gives the grant back.
