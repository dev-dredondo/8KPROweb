/**
 * The one place every in-app ExoPlayer's renderers are configured.
 *
 * Three engines build an ExoPlayer — [LivePreviewEngine] (Live TV's default engine),
 * [ExoSubtitleEngine] (VOD / image-subtitle handoff / mpv fallback) and [HeroPreviewEngine] (the
 * home hero). Each used to configure its own, so a decode-path setting could land on one and not the
 * others: the async-queueing workaround below was live-only, and decoder fallback was on none of
 * them. Anything about *how the device decodes* belongs here so it cannot go missing on one engine
 * again. Per-engine concerns (data source, load control, track selector, listeners) stay at the
 * call site, where they legitimately differ.
 */
/**
 * What every ExoPlayer here plays: media, a movie. Left at the default, the players said "unknown" while the
 * session's audio focus said "movie", and some TV audio HALs pick their movie path from the content type.
 * Also what the passthrough check asks the output about, so it judges the same route the player takes. Focus
 * stays with [PlaybackSession], so the players are given these without handling it.
