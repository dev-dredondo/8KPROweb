 * television has heap for — so it lives here, once, rather than in each app's guide screen.

 * of them ([slice]). There is deliberately no "give me everything in this window" — that existed, and
 * it is what an OutOfMemoryError looks like on a real catalogue.
 *
 * Nothing here caches: what to keep and when to drop it depends on how the screen scrolls, which is
 * the caller's business. The guide shift is passed in for the same reason [LiveEpgReader] takes it —
