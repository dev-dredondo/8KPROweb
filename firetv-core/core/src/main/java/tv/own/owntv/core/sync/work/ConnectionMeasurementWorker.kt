/**
 * Measures how many streams a provider allows, off the setup path.
 *
 * This used to run *inside* the first sync, before any phase. A fresh Stalker add spent 55.7 s
 * going nowhere with nothing logged, and instrumentation attributed **all** of it to this
 * one step: `pre-phase connection measurement ms=55489`. The user sat at "Checking how many channels
 * this provider allows…" for most of a minute before the catalogue even started.
 *
 * It is Stalker-shaped, not universal. An Xtream panel publishes the number, so
 * [ConnectionLimits.needsMeasuring] returns false and the whole thing costs nothing — measured at
 * 700 ms on a phone. Stalker portals and M3U playlists almost never publish it, and for those the
 * only way to know is to open streams and watch, one at a time, until one fails.
 *
 * **Why it could not simply be deferred before.** The measurement works by opening streams, so on a
 * single-connection account it is precisely the thing that cuts the user's picture off — which is
 * why it was pinned to the moment before the first sync, when no channel row exists and there is
 * nothing to interrupt. Moving it later was unsafe because nothing could answer "is the user
 * watching?".
 *
 * [WatchSession] now answers exactly that, so the measurement can wait for a quiet
 * moment instead of taking one hostage. If anything is playing or recording on this source, the
 * worker steps aside and comes back later — the same shape as the catalogue drain.
 *
 * The answer is only needed by Multiview and recordings, both of which ask the budget before they
 * tune. Until it arrives `ConnectionLimits.known()` reports "nobody knows", which those callers
 * already handle — so nothing is broken by it being late, and a minute of setup is given back.
