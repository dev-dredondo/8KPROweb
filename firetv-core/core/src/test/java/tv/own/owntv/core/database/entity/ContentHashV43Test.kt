/**
 * The v43 fields (`manifestType`, `directSource`) are folded into the content hash **only when the row
 * actually carries one**.
 *
 * This is the whole reason the folding in `computeContentHash()` is written as a ladder of null checks
 * rather than one flat `Objects.hash(...)`. Folding unconditionally would change every stored hash at
 * once, so the next resync of a 170k-item catalog would rewrite every row for every user — for a field
 * that is null on well over 99% of them. The KDoc on `ChannelEntity.computeContentHash` says so; these
 * tests are what stops a later edit from quietly undoing it.
 *
 * The other half matters too: a row that *does* declare something must still see a change propagate,
 * or a corrected playlist would never reach the database.
