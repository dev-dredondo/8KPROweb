/**
 * Which playlist the user is watching right now, so background work can step out of its way.
 *
 * This exists because [OpenStreamRegistry] cannot answer the question, although it looks as though
 * it should. That register is the **connection budget** — Multiview tiles and recordings claim
 * against it because they have to ask "may I open one more?". Fullscreen playback never asks, so it
 * never claims, so `openOn(sourceId).total > 0` is false for the single most important case there
 * is. The background catalogue drain was gated on exactly that expression and consequently never
 * yielded once; a channel played for four minutes on the reference portal and the drain paged
 * straight through it.
 *
 * The engines in `:player-core` cannot raise this themselves — they are handed a URL and have no
 * notion of a `sourceId`. So it is the host's playback screen, which holds the row, that opens and
 * closes a session. That makes this one of core's assigned hooks, in the same family as
 * `CoreBuildInfo` and `CrashRecorder.diagnostics`: core owns the state and the meaning, the app
 * supplies the event.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from [OpenStreamRegistry] rather than folded into it. Widening that
 * register would mean fullscreen playback spending from a budget shared with recordings, which
 * would start refusing Multiview tiles the user is entitled to. Nothing here can affect Multiview
 * or recordings at all.
 *
 * Also deliberately not persisted, for the same reason the claim register is not: a session left
 * behind by a crash would hold a drain off forever.
