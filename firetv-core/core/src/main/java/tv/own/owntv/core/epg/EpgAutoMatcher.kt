 * Presentation stays in each app; the decisions do not.
 *
 * Two of those decisions changed here, and both were previously dishonest:
 *
 * **"Needs a match" means no programmes, not an unknown id.** A channel whose `tvg-id` appears as an
 * empty `<channel>` entry in some feed was treated as already having a working guide, so it was
 * skipped on every run, for ever, while its guide row stayed blank.
 *
 * **A winner with no programmes is never applied silently.** A 0.95 name hit onto a guide channel
 * with nothing scheduled was counted as a success and reported as one, leaving the user with the same
 * empty row and a message saying it had been fixed. It now goes to review with its score, so the
 * choice is the user's.
