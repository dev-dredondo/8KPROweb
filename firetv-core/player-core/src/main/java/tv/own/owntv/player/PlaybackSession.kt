/**
 * The app's single point of contact with the rest of the system's audio: **audio focus** and a
 * **MediaSession**. Before this, OwnTV neither requested focus nor published a session, so two
 * apps could play over each other and the TV's transport keys / Assistant "pause" never reached the
 * player.
 *
 * It is engine-agnostic on purpose. OwnTV plays through mpv *and* two ExoPlayer engines, and which one
 * owns the speaker changes with the content; all three already implement [PlaybackEngine], so this class
 * only ever talks to that interface. `OwnTVShell` is the one place that knows which engine is live, so it
 * [attach]es it and passes `null` when the player closes.
 *
 * ### Focus policy: duck, don't pause
 * A TV is not a phone. A navigation prompt, a doorbell camera notification or an Assistant reply must not
 * stop a live channel — a paused live stream falls behind the edge and comes back either late or as a
 * fresh reconnect, and a paused film loses the moment being watched. So:
 *
 * | Focus change | What we do |
 * |---|---|
 * | `LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK` | nothing — `setWillPauseWhenDucked(false)` means the platform attenuates our stream itself, with no HUD-visible volume change |
 * | `LOSS_TRANSIENT` | duck by [DUCK_DB] ourselves and restore on the next gain |
 * | `LOSS` (permanent) | **pause**, and abandon focus. This one is another app taking the speaker for good; continuing is the "two apps playing at once" bug |
 * | `GAIN` | restore the pre-duck volume; playback that we paused stays paused (the user chose the other app) |
 *
 * ### …unless the host is a phone
 * That table is the right answer for a television and the wrong one for a handset: a phone call must
 * **stop** the film, not play it quietly under the caller's voice, and the user expects it back when
 * the call ends. So the policy is a constructor choice — [FocusPolicy.DUCK] is what the TV app has
 * always done and stays the default, [FocusPolicy.PAUSE] is what the mobile app passes. A short
 * notification beep still only ducks under either policy, because that is `CAN_DUCK` and the platform
 * attenuates us without ever telling us.
 *
 * [pauseWhenOutputDisconnects] is the other phone-shaped difference: pulling headphones out mid-film
 * must not carry on through the loudspeaker. It is off by default, because a television's speakers
 * cannot be unplugged from underneath it.
