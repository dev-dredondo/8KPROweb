/**
 * Finishes a Stalker catalogue that setup deliberately left incomplete.
 *
 * The portals this exists for cap a page at ~14 items, so a first import that walked every page
 * would hold the user at a progress bar for four and a half minutes. The setup sweep stops after the first page
 * of every category — every list is immediately browsable — and writes down what it skipped. This
 * worker drains that plan afterwards, invisibly.
 *
 * Three properties it has to have, and where each comes from:
 *
 * - **Resumable.** The drain persists its page cursor after every window, so a reboot, a killed
 *   process or a cancelled worker resumes at the next unfetched page. Re-running a window is free:
 *   `sourceId + remoteId` is unique and the insert ignores conflicts.
 * - **It yields.** Background paging competes with playback for the same portal, and several of
 *   these accounts allow exactly one connection. Between windows the drain checks [WatchSession]
 *   (fullscreen playback) and [OpenStreamRegistry] (Multiview tiles and recordings) and steps aside
 *   the moment either says this source is in use, coming back later.
 * - **It reconciles.** The finish line is the sum of the portal's own *per-category* totals, which
 *   the drain reads back from the plan rows. (Not the synthetic "*" total — that counts items in no
 *   category at all, and a drain chasing it would never finish.)
