/**
 * The category priority's queue re-ordering.
 *
 * The drain re-reads the user's chosen category between *every* category, for minutes at a time, so
 * this runs far more often than it looks. A bug here would not throw — it would quietly starve one
 * category while appearing to work, which is exactly the kind of thing that only shows up as "why
 * is this list still empty" weeks later.
 *
 * The contract: re-ordering only. Nothing is added, nothing is dropped, and the set of categories
 * left to fetch is identical before and after.
