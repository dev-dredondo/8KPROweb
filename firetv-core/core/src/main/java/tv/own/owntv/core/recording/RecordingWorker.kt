/**
 * Runs whatever is due to record, in a **`mediaPlayback`** foreground service so it keeps going once
 * the user leaves OwnTV — and so it is not subject to the six-hours-a-day cap Android 15 puts on
 * `dataSync`, which a DVR would hit. See [RecordingNotifications].
 *
 * One of these at a time (unique work, KEEP). It lives until nothing is recording and nothing is due;
 * the scheduler wakes it again at the next start time.
 *
 * **Network constraint is `CONNECTED`, never `UNMETERED`.** Downloads may wait for Wi-Fi because a
 * film is still there tomorrow; a live programme is not, so a recording runs on whatever connection
 * exists. There is deliberately no "record over Wi-Fi only" here.
