 * The case that prompted this: a Stalker portal whose guide had been emptied answered every route
 * successfully with nothing in it. That arrived as a plain `IOException`, which this worker read as
 * "network trouble" and retried three times with backoff — so Settings → EPG Sources sat on "Connecting…"
 * for six minutes before admitting a failure that was certain from the first second.
