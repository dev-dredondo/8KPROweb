/**
 * A DRM-protected channel is refused rather than recorded.
 *
 * The behaviour this replaces was genuinely harmful, not merely useless. A protected channel used to
 * fall through to the raw byte pump, which wrote the provider's response into the file, hit
 * end-of-body, reported [RecordingFailure.NETWORK] — a reason that is not terminal — and so
 * **reconnected and appended again**, for the entire length of the programme. The user got an
 * unplayable file, the provider got hours of reconnects, and one of the account's connection slots
 * was held the whole time by a recording that could never succeed.
 *
 * It cannot succeed because the CDM decrypts only into a secure decoder for immediate display: there
 * is no point at which this app holds the frames in the clear to write them down. No amount of
 * retrying changes that, which is exactly why the reason must be terminal.
