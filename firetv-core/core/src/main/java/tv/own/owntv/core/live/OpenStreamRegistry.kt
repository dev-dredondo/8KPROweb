 * shared register. Callers claim before they tune and release when they stop; [connectionBudget]
 * turns the counts into an answer.
 *
 * Deliberately not persisted. A claim is only true while the app is running it, and a claim left
 * behind by a crash would refuse tiles for a stream that no longer exists.
