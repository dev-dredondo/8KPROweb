/**
 * The v44 move of a DataStore set into `playback_quirks`, run at most once per install (the old file
 * stays on disk, untouched, for one release). Every read and write of the
 * store awaits it, so nothing is ever read from a half-filled table — a cold-start auto-tune included.
 *
 * [copy] must be idempotent: a crash between it and [markDone] simply repeats it next time.
