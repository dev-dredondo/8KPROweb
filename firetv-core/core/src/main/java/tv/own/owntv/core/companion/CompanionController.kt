/**
 * Owns the Remote companion HTTP listener for the app's lifetime. Registered as a Koin `single` so
 * the Setup and Settings screens share one server instead of each carrying duplicate networking code.
 *
 * The remote browser only fills the Add Source form; it never starts the import. Each submission is exposed two
 * ways:
 *  - [payloads] — a live event stream, used by the Remote screen to know when to hand off; and
 *  - [lastPayload] — the retained latest value, so the Manual form (which subscribes *after* the
 *    hand-off navigation) still sees it. A replay-0 SharedFlow alone would drop it in that window.
 *
 * [start]/[stop] are safe to call from the UI thread; the server does its I/O on its own dispatcher.
