/**
 * "The user is looking at *this* category — fill it first."
 *
 * A lazily-added Stalker catalogue arrives over about sixteen minutes, top-down in the portal's own
 * category order. That is the right default, and for almost every category it is invisible: the
 * setup sweep already stored page 1, so every list opens with something in it.
 *
 * What it does not handle is the user walking straight into a category near the *bottom* of that
 * order. Its first page is there, but the rest is behind fifteen other categories and, if the drain
 * happens to be resting between passes, behind a fifteen-minute timer as well.
 *
 * This is not a read-through paging layer that fetches the missing pages synchronously while the
 * user scrolls. The background drain already exists, and such a layer would have meant a
 * RemoteMediator-shaped hook across every query shape (All / Favourites / History / Custom / Folder
 * × rating / dateAdded / playlist / manual) when only `LiveKey.Folder` maps onto a portal category
 * at all. This is the small version of the same idea: do not fetch differently, just **re-order what
 * is already going to be fetched**, and wake the drain if it is asleep.
 *
 * Deliberately a hint, never a guarantee. If the category is already complete this does nothing; the
 * drain still yields to playback, still resumes from its cursor, and still reconciles against the
 * portal's own totals. Nothing here can make the catalogue wrong — only sooner.
