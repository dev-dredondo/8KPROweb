 * Two things about it are deliberate and are the whole reason it exists.
 *
 * **It does not filter by source.** Every guide *read* stopped doing that (see the "Guide reads:
 * keyed by epgChannelId ALONE" block in [EpgDao]), because which feed delivered a row is not part of
 * a channel's guide identity. The picker and auto-match kept their own filtered query, so the two
 * answered differently: the grid drew programmes for a channel the picker then refused to list, and
 * that reads to a user as "matching is broken". This is the other half of that fix.
 *
 * **It looks at `epg_programmes` as well as `epg_channels`.** A feed is not required to carry
 * `<channel>` entries at all; plenty carry only `<programme>`. Reading the channel table alone made
 * every one of those invisible to the picker while their programmes sat in the database being drawn
 * by the guide.
 *
 * Takes only an [EpgDao] — no source store, no profile — because after the two points above there is
 * nothing else to take. That is also what makes it constructible from either app without ceremony.
