/**
 * The lazy episode cache used to be write-once (`episodeCount > 0` meant "never ask
 * again"), and since the syncers deliberately never fetch episodes either, a show could never gain
 * the episodes a provider added after the user first opened it. Only deleting and re-adding the
 * source worked, by cascade-dropping the rows.
 *
 * Two halves are tested here, both pure: when a refresh happens, and what a refresh does to the
 * rows already stored. The second matters as much as the first — episode row ids carry watch
 * history, resume positions and next-episode autoplay, so a refresh that rebuilt them would trade
 * one bug for a worse one.
