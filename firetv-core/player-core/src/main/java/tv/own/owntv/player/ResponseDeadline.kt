/**
 * A deadline for each live request's response headers: a network interceptor, so every hop of a redirect
 * (the panel, then the media server it picked) gets its own [deadlineMs].
 *
 * The case it exists for: a media server that accepts the connection and the request, then never
 * answers. Nothing else bounds that wait short of the read timeout (20 s), which must stay long because
 * a live TS body can legitimately pause and resume. Measured: a panel's redirect landed on a server that
 * sent nothing for 10.8 s after an outage, until the next reconnect went elsewhere; previews of another
 * channel hit silent servers of the same group three times in an afternoon, none of which ever answered.
 *
 * On a miss the call is cancelled and fails as a timeout, which Media3 retries like any connection
 * failure. Once the headers are in, the deadline is gone — the body keeps the read timeout.
