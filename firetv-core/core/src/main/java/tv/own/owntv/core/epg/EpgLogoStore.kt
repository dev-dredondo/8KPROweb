/**
 * "Use this guide's channel logos" (Settings → EPG Sources → add/edit a feed): channel logos taken from
 * an XMLTV feed's `<channel><icon src>` instead of the ones the playlist carries. Enabled **per EPG
 * source**, so one feed can supply logos while another only supplies programmes.
 *
 * Kept as a process-wide display override rather than being written into `channels.logoUrl` on purpose:
 * the provider logo stays untouched in the database, so turning a feed's toggle off restores it instantly
 * and a catalog re-sync (which REPLACE-upserts every channel row) can't wipe the user's choice.
 *
 * A channel the user matched in Match EPG takes the logo of the guide channel it is matched **to**, not
 * of its own `tvg-id` — the same channel the guide shows for it. The active profile's Live TV matches are
 * followed for that.
 *
 * The map is Compose state, so flipping a toggle or finishing an EPG sync recomposes every logo on
 * screen. Nothing is loaded while no feed has it on — cold start stays free of EPG queries.
